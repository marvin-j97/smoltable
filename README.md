## About

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation_here-blue)](https://marvin-j97.github.io/smoltable/)
[![CI](https://github.com/marvin-j97/smoltable/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/marvin-j97/smoltable/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Smoltable is a tiny wide-column store heavily inspired by [Google Bigtable](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/de//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). It is implemented in Rust and is based on a [custom-written LSM storage engine](https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall), also written in Rust. It can be accessed through a JSON REST API, with potential plans for future embeddability.

## Data model

Its data model is essentially the same as Bigtableâ€™s, where:

- each row is identified by its row key
- the table's ordering is determined by the row key
- a row can have arbitrarily many columns
- columns are grouped into column families - each family is sorted by the column's name (column qualifier)

Each row can have a different set of columns (schema-less). The table is sparse, so unused columns do not count into space usage. Each cell value may have multiple values sorted by time. Optionally, old versions can then be lazily & automatically deleted.

In Bigtable, stored values are byte blobs; Smoltable supports multiple data types out of the box:

- string (UTF-8 encoded string)
- boolean (like Byte, but is unmarshalled as boolean)
- byte (unsigned integer, 1 byte)
- i32 (signed integer, 4 bytes)
- i64 (signed integer, 8 bytes)
- f32 (floating point, 4 bytes)
- f64 (floating point, 8 bytes)

Column families can be grouped into locality groups, which partition groups of column families into separate LSM-trees, increasing scan performance over those column families (e.g. OLAP-style queries over a specific column).

## Compatibility

Smoltable is not a replacement for Bigtable, nor is it wire-compatible with it. It is not distributed, but you probably could make it distributed. Then we would have `Bigsmoltable`. But it is a great, inexpensive way to learn about wide-column and single table data design.
